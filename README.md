# TicTacToe-4x4-.py
The Advanced Tic-Tac-Toe project introduces a strategic 4x4 variant of the classic game, enhanced with  power moves (“Swap” and “Block”) to increase complexity. The primary objective is to develop an AI  opponent using the Minimax algorithm with Alpha-Beta Pruning, capable of handling the expanded  board and new mechanics efficiently.
